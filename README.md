# Introduction

Nest2D is a 2D bin packaging tool for python.

Nest2D works with the C++ libnest2d backend for speed. For python C++ interoperability we use pybind11.
 
The library is written in a way that it should be usable out of the box with a very simple interface. The backend is reasonably fast and robust, being built on top of boost geometry and the 
[polyclipping](http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php) library.

# Install for ubuntu

- need a cpp compiler
- install cmake `pip install cmake`
- install cpp libraries `sudo apt install libboost-dev libpolyclipping-dev libnlopt-cxx-dev`
- clone repo
- load submodules `git submodule update --init --recursive`
- compile and load `pip install -e .`
- run example `python examples/simple_sample.py`


# Example

A simple example may be the best way to demonstrate the usage of the library.

``` python
from nest2D import Point, Box, Item, nest, SVGWriter

def add_shape1(n, items):
    for i in range(n):
        item = Item([
            Point(-5000000, 8954050),
            Point(5000000, 8954050),
            Point(5000000, -45949),
            Point(4972609, -568550),
            Point(3500000, -8954050),
            Point(-3500000, -8954050),
            Point(-4972609, -568550),
            Point(-5000000, -45949),
            Point(-5000000, 8954050)
        ])
        items.append(item)

def add_shape2(n, items):
    for i in range(n):
        item = Item([
            Point(-11750000, 13057900),
            Point(-9807860, 15000000),
            Point(4392139, 24000000),
            Point(11750000, 24000000),
            Point(11750000, -24000000),
            Point(4392139, -24000000),
            Point(-9807860, -15000000),
            Point(-11750000, -13057900),
            Point(-11750000, 13057900)
        ])
        items.append(item)

def main():
    box = Box(150000000, 150000000)
    input = []
    add_shape1(23, input)
    add_shape2(15, input)

    pgrp = nest(input, box)

    sw = SVGWriter()
    sw.write_packgroup(pgrp)
    sw.save()
```

It is worth to note that the type of the polygon carried by the Item objects is
the type defined as a polygon by the geometry backend. In the example we use the
clipper backend and clipper works with integer coordinates.


## Example call

``` bash
$ pip install nest2D
$ python examples/simple_sample.py
